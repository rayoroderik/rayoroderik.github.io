									<h2 class="major">Apple Developer Academy</h2>
									<p>In 2018, I got the scholarship to attend the first Apple Developer Academy in Asia.
									During my time at the academy, I created 4 apps in 9 months, 2 of which is already available on the App Store.
									In total I've worked with 6 different groups in total.
									I got multiple chances to met with a lot of amazing people from Apple and distinguished guests who gave inspirational talk.
									I also got training from Apple Distinguished Educator workshot.
									I loved my experience at the Academy and would love to share it with you!

									<h2 style="color: #988741" class="major">Tarik Tambang</h2>
									<p style="color: #988741" >Tarik Tambang is a hyper-casual multiplayer game inspired by the all-time classic traditional game, Tug of War. Our team made this in just 1 week with a purpose to spark the user's joy emotions by playing this game. During the development, we also challenged to create the app without using any label or text anywhere. We also saw the opportunity to make use of Indonesia's Independence day which was coming soon during the development process. For most of us in the team, this is the first time we developed an app using swift, it was quite a challenge. But, it was still very fun and we are proud of this being our first project.</p>

									<h2 style="color: #5BA2D9" class="major">Bystander</h2>
									<p style="color: #5BA2D9">Bystanders is a game created by 6 youngsters who really care about teens bullying. Bullying in teenagers potentially leads to physical injury, social problems, emotional problems, and even death. Based on our research, bystanders (people who see bullying happens) have the most important role to prevent bad effects on bullying. The reason why they did not stop bullying is that they lack empathy and have less knowledge about how bad bullying effects will. Because of that, we create Bystanders as a visual novel game to raise empathy about how bad bullying can happen to teenagers. We hope users can do more actions to stop bullying because they know what is right to do. The project took two months of research, design, and development. It got approved by an Indonesian clinical psychologist: Ms. Hanlie Muliani, M. Psi., Psi. Bystanders had been launched in AppStore on September 11th, 2018.</p>

										<h2 style="color: #297FAD" class="major">Banban</h2>
										<p style="color: #297FAD">Banban is an app that can help teenagers facing their chronic stress by giving them a sense of achievements. We created Banban because our big idea started with suicide, then we reached out to meet with some NGOs that help suicidal people such as Into the Light and SaveYourselfes.id.  After our discussion with them, we discovered that one of the biggest factors that caused suicide is chronic stress.  So we went to create an app that can help teenagers to manage their stress by doing some activities that can help them relieve their stress.  In total, we developed Banban to the current version in 6 weeks.</p>

											<h2 style="color: #B2855B" class="major">Mowl</h2>
											<p style="color: #B2855B">Mowl is an app to help young people learn about financial literacy, specifically about investment.  Our big idea was Financial Education and during the research, we found out that only a few people are doing investment. We searched for the source of this problem and realized that this happened because there's no proper education about investment for young people. All they got was only the textbook definition of investment product, that's it, no simulation, no real-world case, or any fun or interactive way to stimulate them to do some investment later in the future. That's why we created Mowl to help them play a game of simulation about an investment where they are challenged to make as much profit as possible. They'll also face a relatable case where they will have to choose to spend money and bear the consequences. So far we're almost 2 months in this project and already on the test flight, we're looking to go to the app store as soon as possible!</p>
